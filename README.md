# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Random Forest

## Project Overview
This project predicts handwritten digits (0-9) using a **Random Forest** algorithm. It is built using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, and demonstrates basic machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Dataset:** Trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest, a powerful ensemble learning method.
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations.
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `Matplotlib` for visualizations.

## How It Works
1. Random Forest is trained to classify digits.
2. Model performance is evaluated and visualized.
